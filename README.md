Praise the Lord.
These are little efforts that I do everyday with the great support of TestLeaf team and group members.
Hoping for the best in the days to come.
Learning from Day2: (Nykaa) Xpath for dropdown must include the <select> tag when hierarchaly tracked.
Learning from Day3: 1. (MakeMyTrip) (//div[@class='DayPicker-Body'])[2]//div[text()='" + stringCheckOutDate + "' ]
                      To write an Xpath with a variable in it
                    2.When an element click was not intercepted due to an alert, Actions helped to solve it, by moving to that element                           and then clicking it.
                                 builder.moveToElement(webStar).click().build().perform();
